# Web Development Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Web Development Progress Tracker! This tracker is designed to help me keep track of my progress as I work through the course. I used it to track which lessons I've completed, which exercises I've finished, and which skills I've mastered.

## Course Modules
Here are some of the topics covered in the course:

* HTML
* CSS
